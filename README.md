# C++ Website

This C++ app was made as a part of my YouTube video about creating a C++ app with ChatGPT.

It is my first ever C++ app (which might be obvious)

In the video I used nginx to forward traffic to the application, but in fact it is not needed, and you can go directly to the port the app is listening from the browser.
